# My DECO2017 A3 Webpage: StudBud

## My thoughts on creating this assignment.

Creating a website for StudBud was a really unique experience for me, as I haven't really done much web development before.  I feel quite happy with what I have been able to complete, and although there are a lot of things I could have done better, I think I have represented in my code what StudBud is for.

## Comments on each WebPage
### index (or the Home Page)

I tried to stay as close as possible to my designs I made in A2, as I liked my mock-up designs, and I found creating the home page was one of the trickier designs, but I also think it came out looking the nicest.

The main colours of the website are a light pale pick, and some darker pinks and purples, with a pop of navy blue and dark green so the website would not look so monotonus.  The Home Page represents this the best with the top half being pink, and the bottom half being green.

### Task Manager

I found creating this page the most difficult, as I had trouble sometimes visualising and remembering what all of the selectors and names were all representing.  This page came out looking the most different compared to the A2 mock up, as I decided to use the Convey Quadrants, with my own twist to make them all in a vertical line rather than a box, as I feel like this would be easier for mobile users to read.  

### Timer

Creating the timer functions in JS took a lot of brain power visualising how the time would pass.  This page definitely looks the plainest out of all of them, but I think thats the most important for the timer, so you can see instantly what the time is just at a quick glance, and then continue what you are doing.

### Dictionary

The dictionary's search bar brings back the pop of green which I think helps seperates it from the other elements of the page.  I use the WordAPI to get my definitions and synonyms, although after a bit of testing out different words, some of the definitions are questionable.  I like how the synonyms are all in different boxes, as it makes them stand out more, compared to the definition.

### Music Player

Although I did not create the Music Player, I think it turned out looking really nice with my own website style.  I went through a large royalty-free music website and picked a variety of different songs that would accommodate to a range of different users who enjoy listening to their specific genres, ex. (lo-fi, jazz, classical, atmospheric).

### Other notable design features and ideas
Under each heading of each page, I created a little sub-heading, which helps let the user know what they can do with the webpage, or do while using the webpage, which I also think helps emphasise the calm nature of the website.  

I wanted my website to look calming and not have too much content cluttered on the page, as this could be distracting for the user.  In fact, making the website theme calm, was the biggest factor as to how the website's design came out.  I wanted the user not to be stressed whilst completing these tasks, because no one wants to be stressed whilst studying, and I think my version of StudBud helps create this mood.

## Challenges and tribulations
Creating a lot of the js, and working without immediate visuals was a really tough challenge for me, and because of this, I was not able to create all the functions I wanted.  To try and see how to solve my problems, I viewed a lot of forums such as Stack Overflow, and found many others having similar problems as my own, which was a little comforting.  When I referenced from a website, I tried to change a lot of the code, so that I would understand it in future iterations, and it helped me with the later stages of development.

## So, what next?
I see a lot of improvements could be made with StudBud, such as the increase of tasks that could be performed on it, an increase in the customisability of the website, such as having a dark theme, and perhaps having other out-sourced materials and forums for users to look at.  This assignment has inspired me to better myself at web development, because I have much to learn.  But for now, I am happy with what I've created.
